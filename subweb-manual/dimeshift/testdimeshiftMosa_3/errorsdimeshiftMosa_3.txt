Thu Aug 20 19:21:57 GMT 2020 WARN: Establishing SSL connection without server's identity verification is not recommended.

For compliance with existing applications not using SSL the verifyServerCertificate property is set to 'false'. You need either to explicitly disable SSL by setting useSSL=false, or set useSSL=true and provide truststore for server certificate verification.
